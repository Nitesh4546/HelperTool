#### Description:

**Application** is a multi-functional desktop application created in Python using Tkinter. Designed to simplify various tasks, this tool combines file organization, encryption, decryption, and real-time information display in a user-friendly interface. With an intuitive design, itâ€™s suitable for users looking to manage files efficiently, secure sensitive data, and monitor internet speed in one place. The application includes four main tabs, each offering unique features:

### Features

1. **Home Tab**  
   The Home tab is the main dashboard, providing users with essential information and utilities:
   - **Date and Time**: The current date and time are displayed at the top of the screen.
   - **Quote of the Day**: A motivational or thought-provoking quote appears to inspire users daily.
   - **Waterfall Image**: For a touch of relaxation, a beautiful waterfall image is displayed as the background.
   - **Internet Speed Test**: A button to check the upload and download speeds of the internet connection. Users can quickly assess network performance without needing a separate application.

2. **Organizer Tab**  
   This tab simplifies file management with three core functions:
   - **Choose Directory**: Opens a file explorer window, allowing users to select a folder for organization.
   - **Organize**: The selected directory is scanned, and files are automatically organized into folders based on file type (e.g., images, documents, videos).
   - **Refresh**: Clears the status log, enabling users to start organizing a new directory or re-organize the same one.

3. **Encrypter Tab**  
   Data security is a key feature of Application. The Encrypter tab allows users to encrypt files within a selected directory:
   - **Choose Directory**: Users can select a folder to encrypt all contained files.
   - **Encrypt**: All files within the chosen directory are encrypted, providing an additional layer of security.
   - **Refresh**: Clears the log of encrypted files and directories for a fresh start.

4. **Decrypter Tab**  
   This tab offers decryption capabilities for previously encrypted files:
   - **Choose Directory**: Opens a window to select the folder containing encrypted files.
   - **Decrypt**: Decrypts the files, restoring them to their original form.
   - **Refresh**: Clears the log, making it easy to work with multiple folders in succession.

### Technologies Used
Application is built with various libraries to ensure functionality and user experience:
- **Tkinter**: The primary library for GUI creation, providing a seamless interface for users.
- **time** and **datetime**: For displaying and updating date and time.
- **send2trash**: For moving files to the recycle bin safely.
- **cryptography**: Implements encryption and decryption for user data security.
- **requests** and **bs4 (BeautifulSoup)**: Requests checks for internet speed, while BeautifulSoup can be used for quote retrieval from online sources.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: To display and manage images, such as the waterfall background.
